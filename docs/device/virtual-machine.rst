Virtual Machine
===============

This will quickly take you through the process of bringing up a Hello World
chute in a virtual machine on your computer.

*NOTE*: These instructions assume you are running Ubuntu.  The steps to launch
a virtual machine may be different for other environments.

Environment setup
-----------------

These steps wil download our router image and launch it a virtual machine.

1. Install required packages::

    sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm

2. Download the latest build of the Paradrop disk image. `<https://paradrop.org/release/latest/paradrop-amd64.img.xz>`_
3. Extract the image::

    xz -d paradrop-amd64.img.xz

4. Launch the VM::

    sudo kvm -m 1024 \
    -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::8000-:8000,hostfwd=tcp::8022-:22,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80 \
    -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 -drive file=paradrop-amd64.img,format=raw


First Boot Setup
----------------

After starting the virtual machine for the first time, follow the instructions
on the screen.  When it prompts for an email address, enter `info@paradrop.io`.
This sets up a user account on the router called `paradrop` and prepares the
router to receive software upgrades.  Allow the router 1-2 minutes to complete
its setup before proceeding.

Please note: other than the first boot setup, the system console is not
interactive. There is no username/password to log in through the system
console. Instead, please follow the steps in the next sections to access
your router through paradrop.org or through SSH.


Connecting to your Router with SSH
----------------------------------

The router is running an SSH server, which we forwarded from localhost port
8022 with the options to the kvm command above.  The router does not
accept password login by default, so you will need to have an RSA key
pair available, and you can use the router configuration page to upload
the public key and authorize it.

1. Open tools page on the router (`http://localhost:8080/#!/tools
   <http://localhost:8080/#!/tools>`_). The page might prompt you for
   a username and password. If so, use the username "paradrop" and an
   empty password.
2. Find the SSH Keys section and use the text area to submit your public key.
   Typically, your public key file will be found at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.  You
   can use `ssh-keygen` to generate one if you do not already have one.  Copy
   the text from the file, and make sure the format resembles the example
   before submitting.
3. After the key has been accepted by the router, you can login with the
   command `ssh -p 8022 paradrop@localhost`.


Alternative Setup Using virt-manager
------------------------------------

Even though many developers prefer command line tools to manage virtual
machines, some developers likes to use GUI tools.  In addition, GUI tools are
convenient to support some advanced features, e.g., assigning some peripheral
devices (USB WiFi dongle) from host to virtual machines.  We recommend using
"virt-manager" to run ParaDrop virtual machines.  If you have not installed it
on Ubuntu, you can use below command to install it::

    sudo apt-get install virt-manager

Then we can start virt-manager with below command::

    sudo virt-manager

We can create a VM with the ParaDrop disk image.

  .. image:: ../images/create_vm.png
    :align:  center

Below is the configuration of the VM.

  .. image:: ../images/create_vm_final.png
    :align:  center

After that, we can boot the VM and configure the first boot as we do when run
the VM with command line tools.  However, the VM will have an IP address
192.168.122.x, so we can access http://<IP address of the VM> to access the
portal to upload ssh keys, and then login to it directly with the IP address.

We can assign the USB WiFi dongle from the Host to the ParaDrop VM so that the
ParaDrop running on the VM can support features related to WiFi.  Before we do
that, we need to disable the WiFi device for Host.  We can do that with
"rfkill" command.  Run below command to get the number of the WiFi device::

  rfkill list

Suppose the index of the WiFi device we want to assign to the ParaDrop VM is
2, then run below command to disable it for host OS::

  rfkill block 2

Then we can add the USB WiFi dongle to the VM.

  .. image:: ../images/add_usb_wifi_to_vm.png
    :align:  center

We can run below command in ParaDrop VM to verify that the WiFi device has been
detected::

  iw dev

Sometimes, we have to repeat above steps to make sure the WiFi device can be
used by the ParaDrop VM.
