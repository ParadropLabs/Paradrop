Hardware Support
=========================

This section describes various hardware platforms that we support for running
the ParaDrop edge compute software.

If this is your first time working with ParaDrop and you do not have access to
any of the supported hardware platforms, we recommend starting with our
pre-built virtual machine image, which is covered in the first section below.

After you have an edge node up and running, you will be able to
activate the node with the cloud controller at paradrop.org. The page
:doc:`../manual/index` gives detailed information about that.
